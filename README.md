Chuck Norris Jokes App

I wrote this app using the React JS library for the Co-operative Bank as a tech test for the position of junior developer in February 2020. 

Motivation

The app is designed to generate random jokes about the actor and untouchable martial arts God Chuck Norris. If you don't click it first, it will click you! 

Maintenance

I will continue to check the code and implement any updates on an ongoing basis. I will add any language and library deprecations as they occur. 

Build Status

I intend to add a 'search joke' function in the first week of March 2020. This will enable users to search for a random joke that includes a main character. They will then be able to change the character's name for their own amusement. 

Code Style

This app was written with html, css, js/jsx.

Installation

To preview the app using this github repository, set up a development environment by installing:
VS Code
Git Bash
Node.js
npm

API Reference

The api I was requested to use to make this app is the Internet Chuck Norris Database: http://www.icndb.com/api/ 

Only non-adult jokes are used in the app, executed by a URL request to the api, as so: http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random?exclude=[explicit]

Tests

Tests for this unit have not been installed as yet, but will be included in the folder '___tests___' in the first week of March 2020. 

You can run these tests to ensure the code is firing correctly by navigating to the project folder using your terminal and executing 'npm t'.

Uses

This app is designed for use by anyone, but may be best for adults, young adults and those of Chuck Norris appreciation age.

It was specifically designed initially with UX in mind for people working in an office in need of some light relief on short breaks. It is also designed as a conversation starter with fellow vintage-martial-arts-films-appreciating work colleagues.

Important Notes

This app is in no way affiliated with the Co-operative Bank, Co-operative Group or any other Co-operative entities and is designed as a fun project only. All opinions my own.
